This file is basically some typescript shit we can look back at if we need a refresher and some new concepts

-- What does the typing "void" mean? --

Most of the typings in typescript are self explanatory for example string is a string number is a number but void is a little different

Void is most generally used in functions it is used when functions don't return any value in specific then you can define the function's 
return typing as void. To sum it up if a function doesn't return any value then you have an option to specify the return value as void

-- files ending with .d.ts --

The whole purpose of this file is to define typings of something 

for example: 

export function Multiply(x: number, y: number): number

we can tell that x and y will be numbers and the returning will also be a number but as soon as we try to open the function and start 
writing code in the function it will throw us an error because .d.ts files are meant to just define typings of functions
and nothing else

-- Making your own typings --
