This is a small developer guide on how to make commands on this bot this guide mostly exists to make birb a more bird themed bot
I feel like bots like pancake have everything else aimed except making their bot more like their theme

If a user supplies unsufficent arguments then start off with saying 

üê¶ is angy! *what they are doing wrong* ``` what they should do ```

This will start out every error/things bot cannot process because of unsufficent information. 

<> means it's required 
() means it's optional
[] not required but we recommend it

Again we just want to be creative with this bot so this stands out from other bots! So I recommend putting creativity
as we code the commands
