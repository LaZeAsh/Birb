-- TO DO LIST --


-- Less Important --

This is just more for developer convinience I am going to add a small property in Command interface permissions the property is working for
now but it's done in a really god damn stupid way I spent like 30 minutes tinkering around with it and no luck. Going to make it so we have 
the options of which permissions there are rather than there only being for us to guess it. This doesn't fall in important because the handler
works fine but this will be more convenient

I don't think Sharding and clustering is necessary at the moment because the bot isn't even public yet lmao but as soon as the bot
is released I want to just get the Sharding done with so we can just copy paste the code if needed to (I doubt)

When we are making our repository public for other people to view we are gonna need a markdown file explaining everything so 
draft something and convert it into a markdown package

-- Plans -- 

For hosting of Birb we are going to be using Oracle the specs of the VM is 1 core 1 gig of ram and more than enough storage
I don't think it's necessary to upgrade yet but if we need to I will start paying for hosting at digital ocean probably 

Database Plan - We don't need one at the moment again the free tier from Mongo DB aka the 512 MB will last us a while
I would consider upgrading this when it comes to the point where it's unusable because of the speeds or when we have more people 
using the bot
